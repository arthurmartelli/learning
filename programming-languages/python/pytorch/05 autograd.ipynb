    "# Automatic Differentiation With `torch.autograd`\n",
    "\n",
    "When training neural networks, the most frequently used algorithm is back propagation. In this algorithm, parameters (model weights) are adjusted according to the gradient of the loss function with respect to the given parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute those gradients, PyTorch has a built-in differentiation engine called `torch.autograd`. It supports automatic computation of gradient for any computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the simplest one-layer neural network, with input x, parameters w and b, and some loss function. It can be defined in PyTorch in the following manner:"
